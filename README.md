# unnamed_game_1

Files for an old game I made back in 2018. It has tons of bugs and does not follow any good coding practices, but I'm posting it nonetheless.

You have to run it from the src directory, otherwise it will segfault.

I will look at this and try to document it more thoroughly once I have more time.
